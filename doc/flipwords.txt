Flipwords						*flipwords*

The plugin Flipwords provides the command Flip that changes the order of two 
delimited words on a single line.


:Flip [delimiter] [end-delimiter]			*:Flip*
			Flip two delimited words on a single line. The command 
			accepts 0, 1 or 2 paramteres.

			The parameter [delimiter] is the regex that separates 
			the words.  When omitted it defaults to "\s\+".  The 
			comand tries to preserve the whitespace around the 
			delimiter.

			The parameter [end-delimiter] is the regex that ends 
			the second word.  It is not part of the word.  When 
			omitted it is the same as [delimiter].  When the 
			[end-delimiter] is not found on the line the end of 
			line is used instead.
